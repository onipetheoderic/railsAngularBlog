<!-- We have two text inputs (email & password) both of which are required for form to have a valid state. We are using Angularâ€™s two way data binding on line 8 and 18 to bind the input values to signInUser object in our component class, which means the values will be updated when they are modified in the HTML form by the user, and also updated in the view if they are modified programatically in the component class. -->
